## Modules

### Guide
* A modules folder name begins with `smm_` and is lowercase without numbers
* Each module has a `init.sqf` which is called on mission start in [non-scheduled](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Code_Optimisation#Threads) environment
by the main `init.sqf`.
* Each module should have a `function` folder container a `modulename_functions.hpp`
* The `modulename_functions.hpp` needs to be included in the main `functions.hpp` in the following manner:
```
    class modulename{
		file = "smm_modulename\functions";
		#include "smm_modulename\functions\modulename_functions.hpp"
	};
```
